You will be creating a web site from scratch! Here is the starting point:

<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
	<head> 
	<title>Lab 9</title> 
</head> 
<body> 

</body>
</html>


A)
  - Create your index.html. The above code 
  - Include your jquery mobile css, jquery javascript, jquery mobile javascript

B)
  - Create your first jquery mobile page.
  - Create a footer for that page with 3 sections:
    * Summary
    * Movies/Cars/Websites (Or something you can create a list with!)
    * Setup
  - Create a header for the first page with a text of Summary
  - Create content and put some nifty stuff in there

C)
  - Create 2 additional pages for both the list and the setup
  - Give the pages corresponding ID's and have the links link to those pages

D)
  - Fill the list page with a list of information
  - Go crazy..add some creative things to do!

E)
  - In the setup page add a link button for each of the ajax page transitions
  - Give the links a class of change_transition
  - Add an HTML attribute of "transition" with the corresponding transition as a string
    ex: <a transition="pop">Pop</a>
  - Create an application.js file in a newly created javascripts folder.
  - Register a tap event on the change_transition link
  - In the tap event:
    * Grab the transition from the HTML attribute
    * Set the mobile transition to that attribute and test it out by clicking other links!

F)
  - If you finish this early, create something of your own in jQuery mobile.
